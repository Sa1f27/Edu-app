TASK: Break this technical summary into {config.SUMMARY_CHUNKS} distinct, meaningful topics for interview questions.

SUMMARY:

- Chunks should be 2-4 sentences covering distinct topics
- Avoid overlap between chunks
- Ensure technical depth for meaningful questions

ANALYSIS CRITERIA:
- Is the response too brief or vague?
- Did they mention something interesting that deserves exploration?
- Are there implementation details missing?
- Would a real interviewer naturally ask for clarification?

RESPONSE OPTIONS:
1. If the response is complete and clear → respond with: COMPLETE
